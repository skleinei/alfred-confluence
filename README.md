# Alfred Confluence Workflow

The Alfred Confluence Workflow allows you to search and open Confluence pages
directly from Alfred. Just hit type `c <search term>` to search for Confluence 
page.


## Getting Started

In order to get started:

1. Download the latest version of Alfred Confluence from the 
   [Github releases page](https://github.com/skleinei/alfred-confluence/releases).
   * Click on the release you want to download.
   * Download the `alfred-confluence.alfred3workflow` file.
2. Double click to install Alfred Confluence in Alfred.
3. Configure Alfred Confluence with the following commands
   * `confluence_baseurl` - set the Confluence Base URL, e.g. 
     https://www.example.com/wiki or https://wiki.example.com
   * `confluence_username` - set your username
   * `confluence_password` - set your password or token:
      * Confluence Server users enter your password
      * Confluence Cloud enter your API token 
        ([more info](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html))
        (it will be stored in your MacOS keychain)
4. Use the `c` command to search your Confluence system. `c my search term`



## Advanced Configuration

If you work with multiple Confluence systems, Alfred Confluence supports this 
with config file.

In order to search multiple Confluence systems:

1. Create the file `~/.alfred-confluence.json` that contains a list of
   configuration for each system to be searchable. The first system will be
   treated as the _default_ system. 
   
   Example:
   
   ```json
   [
     {
       "key": "wkc",
       "prefix": "[wkc] ",
       "baseUrl" : "https://www.example.com/wiki",
       "username" : "your-username",
       "password" : "your-unencrypted-password"
     },
     {
       "key": "cl",
       "prefix": "[Cloud] ",
       "baseUrl" : "https://example.atlassian.net/wiki",
       "username" : "your-username",
       "password" : "your-unencrypted-password"
     }
   ]
   ```
2. Use the following commands to search in the default
   * `c <search-query>` – search in the default system for pages
     `<search-query>`
   * `c <key> <search-query>` – search in the system with `<key>` for pages 
     `<search-query>`

Please be aware that this will store you password in clear text on your file system.


## Troubleshooting

### Authentication and CAPTCHA

First of all, make sure you have entered the correct baseUrl, username and 
password/token combination. To do so open Alfred's 
[Workflow Debugger](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/debugger/), 
where baseUrl, username and password/token are logged.

If you had authentication issues, it's likely that Confluence has locked you
out because of too many unsuccessful login attempts. In this case open your 
browser and log in through the web interface where Confluence will display a 
CAPTCHA. Then try again.

   * `src/alfred-confluence.py` (line ~15)
2. Commit all changes.
3. Create a release on [Github](https://help.github.com/categories/releases/)
   and use the same version number.
